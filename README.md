This is a full stack development project created using MERN stack.
It is a part of college project.

### Title-
Hotel Booking System using MERN stack.

### Problem Statement-
A hotel booking system manages information about rooms, reservations, customers, and customer billing. A customer can make reservations, change, or cancel reservations through the hotel website. When a customer makes reservations, he/she needs to check if a room the customer want to reserve is available. If a room is available, the customer enters his/her information to the system and receives a confirmation number from the web site.

### Motivation-
A reservation system, though it might sound like a tool used at the reception desk, is actually an online piece of software that enables guests to book their own stays online and pay for them using a secure portal.
That way, they can complete the transaction quickly, efficiently from the comfort of their own office or living room.

Benefits of online booking system-
•	Less work for the front office
•	Reduced chances of losing or mucking up a reservation
•	Easily gathered data
•	Simpler administration of rewards
